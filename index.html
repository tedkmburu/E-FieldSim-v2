                  This simulation is a sandbox where users can create any electric field they can imagine. The simulation will take the users confugurtation of charges and create electric field lines, field vectors, equipotential lines and voltage maps. Users acan also add test cahrges that will move around in accordance to the electric field that they created.

                  The game is centered around guiding a test charge through a racetrack using an electric field that the player creates by placing charges around their screen. As a person plays the game, they will see dynamic electric field lines created by the charges they place on the screen as well as the trajectory of test charges through the electric field.

                  This series of videos shows people how to build a simulation similar to the electric field one we created from scratch. It is all done in JavaScript using the p5.js library. This is intented to be followed by people with some level of programming experience as well as a general understanding of electric fields.
