                  The objective of this simulation is to improve students' conceptual understanding of how electric fields are impacted by a configuration of charges by creating a dynamic representation of the electric field lines, field vectors, equipotential lines, and the voltage created by the charges on screen. After creating a charge distribution, the simulation visualizes the motion of test charges through the electric field. 
                  <!-- This simulation is a sandbox where users can create any electric field they can imagine. The simulation will take the users confugurtation of charges and create electric field lines, field vectors, equipotential lines and voltage maps. Users acan also add test cahrges that will move around in accordance to the electric field that they created.  -->

                  The game is centered around guiding a test charge through a racetrack using an electric field that the player creates by placing charges around their screen. As a person plays the game, they will see dynamic electric field lines created by the charges they place on the screen as well as the trajectory of test charges through the electric field.
