                            Deepen your grasp of electric fields with our immersive simulation. In the simulation you will explore dynamic representations of electric field lines, field vectors, equipotential lines, and voltage. You can also create custom charge distributions and observe real-time field visualization. Lastly, you can place test charges anywhere on the screen and observe their interaction with the electric field.

                            Embark on an electrifying adventure with our game that challenges you to guide a test charge through a racetrack using electric fields that you create. To beat each level, strategically place charges on the screen then press "Play" to test your design. As you place charges, you will see dynamic electric field lines forming. After beating a level, you can come back and try again for a better score. Students can compete against eachother to rank up in a leaderboard while teachers can monitor their individual progess.
