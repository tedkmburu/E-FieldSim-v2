        <p>
            At this research group, we extend our heartfelt appreciation to the diverse community of artists, designers, coders, and educators who have inspired and influenced our work. Their unwavering passion for creation and continuous improvement has laid the foundation for the powerful tools and resources we use daily. We recognize the invaluable role played by open-source projects in our endeavors, enabling us to learn from and customize existing resources to support our mission.
        </p>
        <p>
            Transparency and collective improvement are at the core of our philosophy. Embracing the spirit of open-source, we aim to contribute to the vibrant community by sharing a significant portion of our code publicly. By doing so, we foster a culture of collaboration, inviting fellow researchers and developers to build upon our work and drive collective progress. Moreover, we strongly believe in removing barriers to physics and all adjacent disciplines. To this end, we provide free access to our resources, striving to make learning more accessible and inclusive for all.
        </p>
        <p>
            We continually seek to incorporate best practices in education, technology, and accessibility into our work. Our dedicated team remains engaged in a perpetual process of learning, ensuring that our resources reflect the latest advancements and techniques. We aspire to inspire future creators and educators to join us in our quest to make physics a subject that is both engaging and approachable. 
        </p>
